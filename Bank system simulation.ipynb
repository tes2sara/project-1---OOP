    "> The aim of this report is to demonstrate the prototype for the ABCBank IT system. The prototype presented is based on the possibility of the Bank's future expansion. The report will focus on implementing the system design decisions and how the business decisions are reflected in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The layout of the report is as follows:\n",
    ">* Shows how methods are composed to produce accounts for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* The implementation of the diverse financial products.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Demonstrate how type matching and adapting a method of the same kind of product can be used to create another object.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* How to count current, savings, and loan accounts and the benefit of doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* how to ensure consistent account creation.\n",
    ">Demonstrate how to structure accounts based on their type for smooth communication.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* finally, how the observer pattern helps to track the base interest rate from a prime lending bank and how to wrap the interest in the home loan before adding an interest charge. \n"

    "> The bank, at the moment, will have three distinguished products available for the customers: Current Account, Loan Account, and Savings Account. The design approach for the products is to use the Strategy Patten. Strategy pattern is a system design pattern that allows one to enclose tightly related products and select one during run time. \n",
    "\n",
    ">There are two essential principles of design here. The first is to identify what part of the code varies and separate it from what stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Secondly, use an interface or template to construct classes rather than implementing code to the actual class.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Based on the assumption that the business design considers the three financial products as the base of the business, it is intuitive to encapsulate the products under class **BankAccount**. Class **BankAccount** has seven abstract(template) methods related to the products. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The abstract **__init__** method creates customers by adopting (encapsulating) the necessary information the particular account requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The abstract method **account** grants the instantiation (representation) of an object created by the **__init__** method to any customer's debit account. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The abstract method **loan** instantiate loan account. A loan account could use the **account** method. However, the decision is made to separate the two methods. The reason for that is that the underlying business logic of opening a customer debit and credit account is handled differently in the financial books of the **ABC Bank**. It is thus assumed that this business logic difference should be referenced in the account creation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The remaining abstract methods can be composed in any account creation. "
